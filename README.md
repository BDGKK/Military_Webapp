- Host and link the images of webpages in node.js

# Project Description
A Full Stack Web Application that helps military retirees and leaver transition smoothly into civilian life.
Provides support for pensions, loans and accomodations to ensure a comfortable and stress-free retirement.

# How to setup the application
1. Install and Setup Node.js on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install and Setup Git on your computer (https://git-scm.com/download/)
    - Use the same account as your GitHub repository
3. Install and Setup MySQL on your computer (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html)
    - Note your host, user, password and port number
4. Install the Redis MSI file on your computer (https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases)
    - Follow this tutorial only until the Redis is installed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OcOv7wh82Y)
    - Go to the folder where Redis was installed and copy the location
    - Open a new Command Prompt terminal in your Code Editor/IDE
    - Change the directory to the Redis folder using:
    ```
    cd "<redis-folder>"
    ```
    - To start the Redis server, only run:
    ```
    redis-server "<redis-folder>/<redis-config-file>"
    ```
    - The redis-config-file is usually 'redis.windows.conf' or 'redis.conf' in the Redis folder (check it properly)
    - There should be no errors in the CMD terminal and the Redis server must have started
    - Stop the Redis server using (Ctrl + C) [Might need to press it twice]
    - If errors occurs, enter the following and repeat the steps again from Step 4.5:
    ```
    redis-cli
    shutdown
    exit
    ```
5. Create a folder for the project and initialize it as a Nodejs App, enter in the terminal:
```
npm init -y
```
6. Initialize git in the folder and connect to the GitHub repository, enter in the terminal:
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/BDGKK/Military_Webapp.git
git branch -M main
```
- Refer the git cheatsheet (https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)
7. Make you are signed in to your GitHub account in your browser
8. Pull the code from this repository into the folder, enter in the terminal:
```
git pull
or
git pull origin main
```
9. Install all the modules, enter in the terminal:
```
npm install cors dotenv express mysql bcrypt googleapis nodemailer redis multer express-session
```
10. Create a .env file in the main directory and enter the following:
```
PORT=(an-available-port-number-on-your-device-or-enter-3000)
DB_HOST='(mysql-host)'
DB_USER='(mysql-username)'
DB_PASSWORD='(mysql-host-password)'
DB_PORT=(mysql-host-password)
WEBSITE_EMAIL='(website-email-from-basecamp-docs)'
WEBSITE_PASSWORD='(website-app-password-from-basecamp-docs)'
GOOGLEDRIVEFOLDERID='<id-of-the-folder-in-your-google-drive>'
```
11. Start the Redis server first
    - Revisit instructions from Step 4.5
12. Start the server using 'npm start' and open the link generated by the console
13. Stop the server by hitting 'Ctrl + C' in the terminal
14. For the frontend developers, only change codes in the client-side folder
15. After making a change to any piece, commit it to Git. For example:
    - If you enabled admin-user-page to send the data to the backend
    - Save the changes, enter in the terminal:
    ```
    git add .
    ```
    - Commit the code, enter in the terminal (Commit msg can be "Enabled admin-user-page to send data to backend"):
    ```
    git commit -m (commit msg)
    ```
    - At end of the day, push all your changes to the GitHub repository, enter in the terminal:
    ```
    git push
    ```
    Or
    ```
    git push -u origin main
    ```
16. Make sure only one person is changing a specific file, otherwise a Merge Conflict may occur
    - Send a message in the Group Chat, telling which file you are changing
    - Make sure no one else works on that file
    - Before changing another file, ask in the group chat whether someone is working on that file
    - Always make sure to push your changes to the GitHub repository after your changes in one day
17. Always pull the code from the repository before starting work, enter in the terminal:
```
git pull
```

# API connections
- admin-user page:
    - GET (domain)/adminUser/(userId)
        - Gets the profile, pensions and loans of the user (Tables: user_table, user_rank, regiments, pension, loan, forces)
