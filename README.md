# To-Do/Issues/Warnings/etc.
- Important Ones
2. Work on feedback form sending message through email
3. Work on storing documents in google cloud (Or use Google Drive API)
4. Work on forget-password verification
    - Get email and new password from frontend
    - Make sure that email is in the database
    - Use uuid module to send a verification code to user's email
    - Save verification code in server memory
    - Get verification code entered by user on frontend
    - Check if user VC and server VC matches
    - If yes, update user's password in database to the new password
    - If no, send error message accordingly
5. Use sessions to dynamically render the webpages for the user
6. Plan and implement a tree for the webpage links (eg: user going to user page and admin goin to admin page)
7. Implement securities in website to prevent unauthorized access (eg: Admin can never visit the admin homepage or user page unless they pass the login page)
7. Deploy the node.js when the important parts of the project is done

- Optional
1. Host all common images and make HTML file use '(domain_name)/(image)' where the image was used previously
3. Optimizing webpages
4. Language Translation in web pages
5. Use socket.io module (websocket) and allow user to interact with admin on chatbot
    - If user enters unavailable questions, chatbot asks user if they want to connect with admin
    - If yes, chatbot backend is removed from websocket connection and replaced with admin
    - Admin gets a notification to interact with user
    - Test this first with 2 users interacting using socket.io and implement in chatbot window later

# Project Description
A Full Stack Web Application that helps military retirees and leaver transition smoothly into civilian life.
Provides support for pensions, loans and accomodations to ensure a comfortable and stress-free retirement.

# How to setup the application
1. Install and Setup Node.js on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install and Setup Git on your computer (https://git-scm.com/download/)
    - Use the same account as your GitHub repository
3. Install and Setup MySQL on your computer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM4aZJW_Ojs)
    - Note your host, user, password and port number
4. Create a folder for the project and initialize it as a Nodejs App, enter in the terminal:
```
npm init -y
```
5. Initialize git in the folder and connect to the GitHub repository, enter in the terminal:
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/BDGKK/Military_Webapp.git
git branch -M main
```
- Refer the git cheatsheet (https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)
6. Make you are signed in to your GitHub account in your browser
7. Pull the code from this repository into the folder, enter in the terminal:
```
git pull
```
8. Install all the modules, enter in the terminal:
```
npm install cors dotenv express mysql bcrypt googleapis nodemailer redis
```
9. Create a .env file in the main directory and enter the following:
```
PORT=(an-available-port-number-on-your-device-or-enter-3000)
DB_HOST='(mysql-host)'
DB_USER='(mysql-username)'
DB_PASSWORD='(mysql-host-password)'
DB_PORT=(mysql-host-password)
WEBSITE_EMAIL='(website-email-from-basecamp-docs)'
WEBSITE_PASSWORD='(website-app-password-from-basecamp-docs)'
```
10. Start the server using 'npm start' and open the link generated by the console
11. Stop the server by hitting 'Ctrl + C' in the terminal
12. For the frontend developers, only change codes in the client-side folder
13. After making a change to any piece, commit it to Git. For example:
    - If you enabled admin-user-page to send the data to the backend
    - Save the changes, enter in the terminal:
    ```
    git add .
    ```
    - Commit the code, enter in the terminal (Commit msg can be "Enabled admin-user-page to send data to backend"):
    ```
    git commit -m (commit msg)
    ```
    - At end of the day, push all your changes to the GitHub repository, enter in the terminal:
    ```
    git push
    ```
    Or
    ```
    git push -u origin main
    ```
14. Make sure only one person is changing a specific file, otherwise a Merge Conflict may occur
    - Send a message in the Group Chat, telling which file you are changing
    - Make sure no one else works on that file
    - Before changing another file, ask in the group chat whether someone is working on that file
    - Always make sure to push your changes to the GitHub repository after your changes in one day
15. Always pull the code from the repository before starting work, enter in the terminal:
```
git pull
```
