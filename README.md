# To-Do/Issues/Warnings/etc.
- Important Ones
0. Make logo available to all pages
1. Host admin pages on server
2. Connect the webpages to the server (sample responses only)
3. Use Google Oauth and Encryption before storing registry in db
4. Make a list of URIs of webpage connections to their APIs and send to frontend devs to implement the webpage connections, each consist of:
    - Web page name
    - URI name
    - What data to send to and get from the API
5. Create GET, POST, PUT methods for each API where needed and exchange sample data
6. Add database queries to the APIs where needed
7. Send user login data to backend
    - Use Google Oauth to verify the user email (change database tables accordingly)
8. Send user registration to backend
    - Use bcrypt module to encrypt the password (do not encrypt NIC and other details)
9. Deploy the node.js when the important parts of the project is done

- Use socket.io module (websocket) and allow user to interact with admin on chatbot
    - If user enters unavailable questions, chatbot asks user if they want to connect with admin
    - If yes, chatbot backend is removed from websocket connection and replaced with admin
    - Admin gets a notification to interact with user
    - Test this first with 2 users interacting using socket.io and implement in chatbot window later
